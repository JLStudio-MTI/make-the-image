  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Make the Image</strong> is a hobby web app: a friendly, collaborative pixel art game where everyone places pixels together on one big canvas. This policy explains what we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage your info. We keep things simple: no required logins, no email collection, and no selling of your data—ever.</p>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Summary (Too Long; Didn’t Read)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We store pixels you place (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, color, timestamp, and the username you chose).</li>
    <li>Your username and cooldown timer may live in <code>localStorage</code> so the site remembers you.</li>
    <li>We may use privacy-friendly analytics (like Plausible) or GA4, and ads (AdSense).</li>
    <li>No accounts, passwords, or emails required by default.</li>
    <li>We don’t knowingly allow children under 13 to use the service.</li>
    <li>You can ask us to remove a username or specific pixel data that reasonably identifies you.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="note">For details, keep reading the sections below.</p>
</div>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>When you use the app, we collect the minimum data needed to make collaborative art work and keep the experience fair:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pixel Placements:</strong> Each placement includes coordinates (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>), <code>color</code>, a <code>timestamp</code>, and your <strong>chosen username</strong>. This data is public by design (that’s the fun of a shared canvas) and helps with features like the live board, history, and leaderboards.</li>
  <li><strong>Username:</strong> You pick a display name. We save it in the database and also in your browser (via <code>localStorage</code>) so you don’t have to retype it. Usernames are public on the site.</li>
  <li><strong>Basic Analytics:</strong> We may measure visits, page events, device/browser types, and general usage to improve performance and stability. Depending on configuration, we may use <em>Plausible</em> (cookieless, privacy-friendly) and/or <em>Google Analytics 4 (GA4)</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Ad Data:</strong> If AdSense is enabled, Google may process information (e.g., ad cookies or identifiers) to serve and measure ads.</li>
  <li><strong>Server/Hosting Logs:</strong> Our hosting provider may automatically log IP addresses and requests for security, debugging, and preventing abuse.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cookies & Local Storage</h2>
<p>We aim to use <code>localStorage</code> rather than cookies for core gameplay. Typical keys include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>pp_username</code> – your chosen display name</li>
  <li><code>pp_lastPlacedAt</code> – the timestamp used to calculate your placement cooldown</li>
</ul>
<p>Analytics and ads may use cookies or similar technologies as required by those services. You can clear cookies and local storage in your browser settings at any time, but you may lose your saved name and timer state.</p>

<h2>Why We Use Your Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Provide the Service:</strong> Render the shared canvas, enforce cooldowns, show leaderboards, and attribute art to usernames.</li>
  <li><strong>Improve & Debug:</strong> Understand usage patterns, monitor performance, and fix issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety & Fair Play:</strong> Prevent spam, abuse, and vandalism; comply with legal requests when required.</li>
  <li><strong>Monetization:</strong> Show ads (if enabled) to cover hobby hosting costs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We may rely on trusted providers to run the app:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Plausible and/or Google Analytics 4 to understand usage. Plausible focuses on privacy and typically avoids personal data; GA4 may use cookies/identifiers depending on your browser settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> Google AdSense to display ads. Google may use cookies and personal data as described in their policies. You can manage ad personalization in your Google settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Hosting/Infrastructure:</strong> Cloud providers that store pixel data and logs, and deliver the site globally.</li>
  <li><strong>Content Delivery & Security:</strong> CDNs or anti-abuse tools that help reliability and mitigate attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>These services have their own privacy policies and may process information as independent controllers. We aim to integrate them with the most privacy-respecting settings that keep the site functional.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing & Selling</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data. We share data only with service providers that help us run the site, or when required by law, to protect rights, safety, or enforce our Terms.</p>

<h2>Retention</h2>
<p>Pixel data is part of the public canvas history, which is core to the project. We intend to keep it so the art and leaderboard make sense over time. Analytics and logs are kept for the shortest practical period that helps us understand usage and protect the service, then aggregated or deleted.</p>

<h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Use without cookies (where possible):</strong> If Plausible is enabled alone, we may avoid cookies. If GA4/AdSense cookies appear, you can block or clear them via your browser or opt-out tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Change or Remove Your Username:</strong> You can pick a new name anytime. If you want us to remove or anonymize a username that reasonably identifies you, email us using the address below.</li>
  <li><strong>Pixel Removals:</strong> Because the canvas is a public art record, we typically don’t remove valid placements. We <em>may</em> remove content for policy reasons (e.g., hate symbols) or legal obligations.</li>
  <li><strong>Access/Deletion Requests:</strong> If you believe we hold personal data about you beyond public canvas entries, contact us and we’ll help where feasible.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Do Not Track</h2>
<p>Most browsers let you send a “Do Not Track” signal. There’s no universal standard yet. We try to select tools that minimize tracking and respect your browser controls where possible.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>We don’t knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you’re under 13, please don’t use the site. If you’re a parent/guardian and believe a child has used the service, contact us so we can remove any data that may identify them.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures—like reputable hosting, HTTPS, rate limiting, and moderation workflows—to protect data and keep the canvas fair. No method is 100% secure, but we aim for simplicity and least-data design to reduce risk.</p>

<h2>International Users</h2>
<p>Our app may be hosted in different regions. By using the service, you understand your information may be transferred and processed where our providers operate. We select mainstream vendors with strong security practices.</p>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>Community posts or ads may link to other websites. We’re not responsible for those sites’ privacy practices. Check their policies if you visit them.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy as the project evolves (for example, if we add new features like optional accounts). We’ll change the date at the top and, when appropriate, provide a more prominent notice in-app. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Legal Basis & Controller</h2>
    <p>This is a hobby project operated on a “minimum data” basis to provide the canvas, ensure fair play, and keep the lights on via analytics and ads. Where applicable, our legal bases include performance of a service, legitimate interests (safety, improvement, moderation), and consent where required for cookies/ads.</p>
